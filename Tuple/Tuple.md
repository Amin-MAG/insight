#about_Tuples_in_python:
Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable. A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0]
you can add something to tuple by using append and also delete by using remove.,
The del keyword can delete the tuple completely.
To join two or more tuples you can use the `+` operator
To multiply you can use the `*` operator

count()>> Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple

index()>> Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found
