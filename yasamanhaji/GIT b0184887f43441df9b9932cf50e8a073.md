## **What is GitHub?**

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web-based interface that uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/), the open source version control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the same time. As Carpenter notes, because it allows for real-time collaboration, GitHub encourages teams to work together to build and edit their site content.

## **How Can GitHub Help My Team and Me?**

GitHub allows multiple developers to work on a single project at the same time, reduces the risk of duplicative or conflicting work, and can help decrease production time. With GitHub, developers can build code, track changes, and innovate solutions to problems that might arise during the site development process simultaneously. Non-developers can also use it to create, edit, and

## **How Do I Speak GitHub?**

During the video, Carpenter defines some of the common terms teams will need to understand when using GitHub. They are:

- **Repository (repo)** — a folder in which all files and their version histories are stored.
- **Branch** — a workspace in which you can make changes that won’t affect the live site.
- **Markdown (.md)** — a way to write in Github that converts plain text to GitHub code. Sites such as [Atom](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) are examples of free resources for developers using Markdown.
- **Commit Changes** — a saved record of a change made to a file within the repo.
- **Pull Request (PR)** — the way to ask for changes made to a branch to be merged into another branch that also allows for multiple users to see, discuss and review work being done.
- **Merge** — after a pull request is approved, the commit will be pulled in (or merged) from one branch to another and then, deployed on the live site
- **Issues** — how work is tracked when using git. Issues allow users to report new tasks and content fixes, as well as allows users to track progress on a project board from beginning to end of a specific project.
- **[Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov/features/)** — a platform that securely deploys a website from a GitHub repository in minutes and lets users preview proposed and published changes.
